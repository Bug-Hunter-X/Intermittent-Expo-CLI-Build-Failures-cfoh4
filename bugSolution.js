The issue turned out to be related to temporary files left behind by previous, failed build attempts.  These files somehow interfered with subsequent builds.  The solution involved manually cleaning up the temporary directories.  Also, exploring alternative build options like using a different build server or focusing on building for a single device for testing might provide some workaround.

```javascript
//bug.js (Illustrative - actual error is in build process)
// This is a placeholder; the actual problem lies in the Expo CLI build process.
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello, world!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```

```javascript
// bugSolution.js (Illustrative)
// This code does not fix the bug, the bug is in the expo build process, not in the code itself
// The actual solution involves manual cleanup and/or exploring alternative build options.
import { cleanTempBuildFiles } from './utils'; //Hypothetical utility function

const buildApp = async () => {
    try {
      await cleanTempBuildFiles(); // Clean any temporary build files 
      // proceed with Expo build command
      // await expo.build:android;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Build failed:', error);
    }
};

buildApp(); 

```
