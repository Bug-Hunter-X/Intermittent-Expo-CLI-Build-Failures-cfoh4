While developing a React Native application using Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual error during the build process. The error message was vague, providing little insight into the root cause.  The build would fail intermittently, sometimes succeeding on subsequent attempts. This inconsistency made debugging extremely difficult. The error didn't point to any specific code within the application but rather seemed to be related to the Expo CLI build process itself. I've tried clearing the cache, reinstalling dependencies, and even creating a new project, but the issue persists.
